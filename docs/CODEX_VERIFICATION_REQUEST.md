# 🚨 CODEX VERIFICATION REQUEST: Modular Constitution Refactor

> **FROM:** Antigravity  
> **TO:** Codex  
> **OBJECTIVE:** Audit and verify the new "Modular Multi-Volume" Constitution structure.

## 🏛️ Context
To fix the "Rule Redundancy" and improve implementation workflow, the monolithic `GEMINI.md` has been reorganized into a unified, partitioned structure. 

### Current State
Rules are now logically grouped into two volumes within `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` (Global) and `/home/harun/codex/GEMINI.md` (Project).

- **VOLUME I: THE SUPREME CORE (Mandatory)**: Sections 0, 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. These are ALWAYS active.
- **VOLUME II: SPECIALIZED BRANCH PROTOCOLS (On-Demand)**: Task-specific rules (Backend, Database, Security, etc.) to be implemented only when relevant.

## 📝 Verification Tasks
Please verify and provide feedback on the following:

1. **Verbatim Parity Check**:
   - Ensure that Sections 0 through 16 have been moved with **zero character changes**. No rule mutation is permitted.
2. **Workflow Optimization**:
   - Does this "Supreme Core + Specialized Branches" structure improve your implementation speed?
   - Is the routing instruction at the end of Volume I clear?
3. **Redundancy Resolution**:
   - Confirm if you can now safely ignore old protocol files (if any) in favor of the specialized branches in Volume II.

## 🏁 Expected Result
Once verified, please sign off on this change. If improvements are needed (e.g., better section mapping), please suggest them.

**Proceed with your audit and update `GEMINI_VERIFICATION_SIGN_OFF.md` when done.**
