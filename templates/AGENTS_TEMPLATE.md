# Agent Rules - Project Boundary Contract

## Scope
- This repository is for one project only.
- Do not add files for unrelated projects.

## Start Rule
- Before coding, verify the project root path.
- Create a clear structure first:
  - `docs/`
  - `src/`
  - `assets/`
  - `scripts/`
  - `README.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`

## File Hygiene
- Keep planning/architecture docs under `docs/`.
- Keep implementation under `src/`.
- Avoid random files at root unless truly global config.

## Cross-Project Safety
- If asked to build another project, create a new dedicated folder first.
- Never mix files from two products in one repo.
